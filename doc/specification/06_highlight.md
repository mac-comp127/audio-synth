# Note highlighting specification

Your goal: highlight the currently playing notes. Any rectangles that represent currently playing notes are filled with white. When the notes are done playing, the rectangles go back to their original colors.

We leave this to you as a challenge. It is a little tricky, but it does not take a lot of code — and it looks _awesome!_

For the full effect, it is nice to make the “current time” position in the window about 200 pixels in from the edge, and draw a thin vertical line there. This lets you see a little bit of the past as well as the future as the music scrolls by.
