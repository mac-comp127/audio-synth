# Part 5 (bonus): Highlight notes

Your goal: highlight the currently playing notes.

Any rectangles that represent currently playing notes are filled with white. When each note is done
playing, its rectangles goes back to its original color.

There are several ways to implement this. Contact your instrutor if you want a hint!
