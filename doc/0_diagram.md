# Part 0: Draw a diagram of the existing classes

In `src/`, you will find 13 Java classes. Draw a diagram of their relationships.

Here are the rules:

- Draw an arrow any time there is a relationship between two class, and **label every arrow**. That relationship label could be:

    - “is a”
    - “has a”
    - “creates”
    - or some other transitive verb phrase.

    There is not always a single correct way to express a relationship. Try to convey the core idea of the relationship between the classes accurately but concisely.
- You only need to diagram the **classes themselves**. You do not need to draw every method or instance variable.
